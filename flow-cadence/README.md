# Getting set up
In our development process, we used flow testnet to test our smart contracts. 
[Here](https://docs.onflow.org/dapp-deployment/testnet-deployment) is a tutorial created by Flow that leads you through testnet. 

Here's our version of the tutorial for deploying contracts in testnet: 

## 1. Create A Flow Testnet Account

You'll need to have installed the Flow CLI, which can be done easily by following these [steps](https://docs.onflow.org/flow-cli/install)

### Generate a key pair (public and private keys):
Make sure you are running the flow emulator
  
    flow keys generate
You will be gerneated a Private Key and a Public Key. Store these keys (especially the private key) somewhere safe

### Request your account
Go to [Testnet Faucet](https://testnet-faucet-v2.onflow.org/)
