  <b>Welcome to Batstoi's digiYo repository!</b>
  </p>
  
## What is digiYo?

digiYo is [Batstoiâ€™s](https://batstoi.com/) nonfungible token game developed with flow cadence featuring various martial arts through 3D animations created using motion capture technology. 

Our video game provides an interactive and engaging experience for you to make the most out of digiYo. We support in-game buying of card packs, inter-user trading, and more through the [Blocto](https://blocto.portto.io/en/) app.

## What is this repository?
This github repository was made to record our work on a public interface to both receive and offer feedback from the rest of the [flow](https://www.onflow.org/) community! This dev doc includes Cadence files for our digiYo minting based on blockchain and transactions and Node JS files for our webapp. 

## Requirements for following through 
If you wish to run this repository, you will need to [install Flow Command Line (FCL)](https://docs.onflow.org/flow-cli/install).
