  <b>Welcome to Batstoi's digiYo repository!</b>
  </p>
  
## What is digiYo?

digiYo is [Batstoiâ€™s](https://batstoi.com/) nonfungible token game developed with flow cadence featuring various martial arts through 3D animations created using motion capture technology. 

Our video game provides an interactive and engaging experience for you to make the most out of digiYo. We support in-game buying of card packs, inter-user trading, and more through the [Blocto](https://blocto.portto.io/en/) app.

## What is this repository?
This github repository was made to record our work on a public interface to both receive and offer feedback from the rest of the [flow](https://www.onflow.org/) community! This dev doc includes Cadence files for our digiYo minting based on blockchain and transactions and Node JS files for our webapp. 

## Requirements for following through 
If you wish to run this repository, you will need to [install Flow Command Line (FCL)](https://docs.onflow.org/flow-cli/install). 

## Webapp Design

Creating a webapp utilizing blockchain from scratch may be daunting and confusing. This outline (with a bunch of cool dropdowns) may help you understand the format better!

### Legend
<ul>
  <li> Files that end with "tx" are transactions that involve the movement of items and information associated with the address</li>
  <li> Files that include ".script" are checking information associated with that address

                                Its structure is neither what would be if it was the simplest possible market contract or if it was a complete general purpose market contract. Rather, it iis the simplest possible version of a more general purpose market contract that indicates how that contract might function in broad strokes. This has been done so that integrating with this contract is a useful preparatory exercise for code that will integrate with the later more general purpose market contract.
