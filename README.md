  Welcome to Batstoi's digiYo development document!
  </p>
  
## What is digiYo?

digiYo is [Batstoiâ€™s](https://batstoi.com/) nonfungible token game developed with flow cadence featuring various martial arts through 3D animations created using motion capture technology. 

Our video game provides an interactive and engaging experience for you to make the most out of digiYo. We support in-game buying of card packs, inter-user trading, and more.

## What is this dev doc?
This github repository was made to record our work on a public interface to both receive and offer feedback from the rest of the [flow](https://www.onflow.org/) community. This dev doc includes Cadence files for our digiYo minting and transactions and Node JS files for our webapp.
